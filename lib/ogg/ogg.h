    Absolute granule position.

    (This is packed in the same way the rest of Ogg data is packed;
    LSb of LSB first.  Note that the 'position' data specifies a
    'sample' number (eg, in a CD quality sample is four octets, 16
    bits for left and 16 bits for right; in video it would likely be
    the frame number.  It is up to the specific codec in use to define
    the semantic meaning of the granule position value).  The position
    specified is the total samples encoded after including all packets
    finished on this page (packets begun on this page but continuing
    on to the next page do not count).  The rationale here is that the
    position specified in the frame header of the last page tells how
    long the data coded by the bitstream is.  A truncated stream will
    still return the proper number of samples that can be decoded
    fully.

    A special value of '-1' (in two's complement) indicates that no
    packets  finish on this page.

  /*M
    Stream serial number.

    Ogg allows for separate logical bitstreams to be mixed at page
    granularity in a physical bitstream.  The most common case would
    be sequential arrangement, but it is possible to interleave pages
    for two separate bitstreams to be decoded concurrently.  The
    serial number is the means by which pages physical pages are
    associated with a particular logical stream.  Each logical stream
    must have a unique serial number within a physical stream:

    and then continued over the page. The CRC field is then filled
    with the computed value.

    possible physical page size at 65307 bytes or just under 64kB
    (thus we know that a header corrupted so as destroy
    sizing/alignment information will not cause a runaway bitstream.
    We'll read in the page according to the corrupted size information
    that's guaranteed to be a reasonable size regardless, notice the
    checksum mismatch, drop sync and then look for recapture).
